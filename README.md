# HCI: Creating a Better Weather App 
## Part 1: Need-Finding
### KEY FEATURE SET:
Inspiration 1. People use the weather app relative to daily or future events. I propose giving suggested events info based on weather. For example:
* Recommend hiking or outdoors activities (or indoors/things to do?) based on good weather later in the week
* Recommend cancel picnic trip based on rain
* Recommend go these locations for sunset
Inspiration 2. People more often use the weather based on travel plans. I propose an app that crowd-recommends clothes packing based on upcoming trips
* Shows the weather information on a calendar (aligns with Google Calendar events)Notification-based information
* Visible home screen notification or widget in the mornings
* Gather all the info you need in a single look
